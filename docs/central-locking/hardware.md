# Hardware

## Actuators
I bought [these](https://a.aliexpress.com/_EQsu6tF) relatively cheap actuators (I first got the 5-wire ones, but ended up only using two of their wires)

Then I just used some thin sheet metal to mount the actuators in the doors and laid their wires to the trunk.

## Control electronics
For controlling the door actuators I'm using two relays and for the trunk actuator only one since it only needs to unlock.

The black box is a "Remote Central Control Box Kit" I could probably control the actuators on its own, but I want more control, so I'm just using it to have a pre-made remote. (If you only want Bluetooth you don't need it at all)

Here is an overview of all the electronics:
