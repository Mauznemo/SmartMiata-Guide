# Making the power circuit case

Now we need a case for the circuit from the last step.

To make these cases you need a 3D printer or some other way to get 3D printed parts. I made all designs in [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360)

This case is designed to fit the main power relay and one LM 2596S to convert the ignition switched 12V down to 5V.
