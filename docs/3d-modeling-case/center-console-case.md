Now we need a case for all the electronics.

## Components explained

### Main case

If you decided to use different components than I did, you can still use this part as a base for your own 3D model.

### Popups controller box

This box has two layers/floors the bottom one for the 4 relays and the top one for the Arduino that controls the popups.

The relays:

### Computer case

This is the case for the youyeetoo X1 computer, and it also fits one of the USB hubs. (USB ports facing forward)

### Power supply

This is the case for the power supply, it is designed to house two buck converters. One big one and one small one (the [XL4015 DC-DC and LM 2596S DC-DC](/docs/buying-the-hardware#other-things-we-need)).

This would look something like this:
